You can choose whether you want to use the speed or not. To begin with drive.py just sets a constant speed, which works fine, so you don't need to do anything specific with speed if you don't want to.  You don't need to one-hot encode for this because it isn't a classification problem. It is a regression so you want to predict a continuous output instead of a discrete class.

Regression problem.
